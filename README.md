## Link to an interesting article: [Here!](https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/what-are-the-biggest-threats-companies-face-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-s-response-11662948781923.html)<br></br>


The article is about Google CEO, Sundar Pichai's response when asked about the biggest threats companies face. Here, he answers saying "Big companies, particularly, fail because they stumble internally". He highlights the incompetence of big companies to only focus on external factors rather than understand their internal environment. This might sound small but at the end of the day internal matters are what the company can handle and execute properly rather than anticipating external threats. The same applies to software engineering/development, teams can only account for themselvves and their work, the success depends on the internal execution rather than being aware of what's going on outside.

#### Comment from Safal:
Fully agree with you on this. I think coordination among the different moving parts in software development is the most important no matter the expertise of an individual in the team. If there's no proper coordination, however talented the team may be, it'll go wasted.
